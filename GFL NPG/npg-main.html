    <p class="header">INTRODUCTION</p>
    <p class="text">Girls' Frontline is a mobile game focused around asset development and management with strategic flair, whose primary strengths include the practicality of enjoying the game as a free-to-play participant. The game consistently rewards the progression of the dedicated, and is much more forgiving than the vast majority of gacha games on the market in terms of how much luck or money is required. That being said, one should aim to get the most possible from their time and effort, and this guide is here to help develop commanders capable of operating efficiently.</p>

            This will vary from player to player to player, but a good rule of thumb is to stop non-daily crafting and doll contract rush whenever a sturdy main tank is produced <span class="italic slightfade">(see right— "What should be crafted?" under "Pointers?")</span> or when the first three AR Team dolls have been acquired, at which point one should just press on with grinding out levels (even suboptimal tanks will suffice).

            It is fortunate for new players that sufficiently strong friend supports can clear the required stages in the player's stead, so be sure to ask for help! However, the player's echelon still needs to be strong enough to defend allied headquarters from enemy capture. For this purpose, these low-rarity dolls will serve well along the way:

            - If UMP <span class="italic slightfade">(preferably 45, though 9 is still great)</span> or Ingram are available, use as main tank. If not, use the Sten MkII provided as story reward.<br>
            <p class="texttenpx">- To avoid core hell, one 5★ doll at most should be used unless three of the dolls in formation are 3★ dolls or lower. It is generally not recommended to use any 5★ dolls if four of the dolls in formation are 4★.</p>
            <p class="texttenpx">- With this in mind, choose an offtank; Skorpion will suffice if no better choices are available <span class="italic slightfade">(PPS-43, SR3-MP, Vector)</span> or the team's core costs will be prohibitive.</p>
            <p class="texttenpx">- Similarly, choose who will serve as DPS ARs. Generally, the AR Team is recommended due to their value as the best 4★ ARs around <span class="italic slightfade">(a great intersection of power and accessible cost)</span>, but if one insists on using a 5★ AR, the target for replacement would generally be best served by M4 SOPMODII.</p>

            This depends on one's priorities-- RFHG strongly augments one's night battle capabilities against armored units, however a second ARSMG can still fill this role relatively well while being more versatile across the board.
